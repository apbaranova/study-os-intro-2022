Bow down my sister, you've taken the veil
Locked up desire and buried your grail
Christ in your heart and the poison in mind
Merciful father bring light to the blind
Carry the cross under sacred command
When down your body the priars descend
Sacramental sister in heaven or hell
When the night is falling, no moral can tell
Sacramental sister, to God you are sworn
When desire calling, the Bible is torn
